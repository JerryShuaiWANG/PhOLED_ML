# PhOLED_ML
These are the data and code for the draft 
"Predictions of photophysical properties of phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes based on ensemble machine learning approach"
about predictions of three vital photophysical properties in PhOLED emitters. 

Raw_data includes the optimized T1 structures and the features with experimental data for all the samples used in the paper. The sample division method can be seen in the directory as well.

All the code and data for three properties can be seen in the directories respectively. 

The code is executed under python environment. Details can be seen in the requirements.txt 

If there are any questions, please contace me freely.
